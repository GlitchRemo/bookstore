					This textbook for Class XII English course has been developed on the
					basis of the recommendations made in the National Curriculum Framework
					2005. It follows the design of the Class XI textbook, Hornbill,
					published in 2006. The prose selections aim to provide exposure to a
					wide variety of genres and themes, and writing from different parts of
					the world. They take into account the interests of young adults while
					making them aware of the socio-political issues that they will
					confront as they step into the world outside school. The tasks that
					follow the units provide opportunities for the development of language
					skills
